            <li>1 cup apple pie filling</li>
            <li>2 pouches apple cider powdered drink mix</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Separate Hawaiian rolls and cut a 1/2-inch slit in the side of each one. Use a finger or the end of a spoon to create a larger opening and a space large enough to fill each roll with about 1 tablespoon filling.</li>
            <li>Roughly chop apple pie filling and add to a bowl. Stir in 1 packet apple cider mix. Spoon filling into the prepared rolls.</li>
            <li>Melt 4 tablespoons butter and brush each roll on all sides with melted butter. Place rolls on a lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until lightly toasted and golden brown, 12 to 14 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, stir together remaining apple cider packet, sugar, and cinnamon in a shallow dish and melt remaining butter.</li>
            <li>Brush tops of rolls evenly with melted butter and coat each roll in sugar mixture.</li>
        </ol>
